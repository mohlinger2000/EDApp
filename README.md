# EDApp

This app is being designed as a personal project for those recovering from an eating disorder.
## Get Started
Download EDApp.apk and run on Android phone/emulator to see it in action.
## What the App Will Do:
The app will log the meals and snacks had throughout the day while avoiding triggers such as calories, fats, and 
carbohydrate counts and will include an function to set alarms and remind the user to eat when they set them. 
It will also include a calender to track the last day one has binged, purged, or restricted in order to encourage 
healthier eating habits and help the person recovering from relapsing into old habits. Tracking weight will not be 
included anywhere in the app since it is a potential trigger and is not the focus of this particular app. We eventually 
want to be able to add a chat function that will match the person with someone willing to chat with them in real time 
for when they feel particularly alone or need to talk about the struggles they may be facing during recovery.

## Developers:
